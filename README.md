Measuring Dendrite Formation via SAM 

Done in Collaboration with LBNL and the computing science division under Daniela Ushizima.

In this project we evaluate the performance of Meta's Segment Anything Model (SAM) in order to test whether it may be used in order to help aid the analysis of Lithium Metal Batteries. The analysis is done by comparing its results to smaller MLP and RF models and then evaluate their metrics.
